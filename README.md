# insporation\*

A native [diaspora\*](https://diasporafoundation.org) client powered by Flutter.

> This is still in preview. You will need a pod on the latest develop branch. Contributions are welcome, please open an issue if you work on something bigger to avoid duplicated effort :)

## Installation

As soon as this is out of preview it will appear in the usual stores. Until then you have the following options:

### Android

#### Download latest nightly build

You can go to the [releases page](https://github.com/jhass/insporation/releases) to download and install the latest build manually.

#### F-Droid repository

The nightlies are also published to a F-Droid repository which you can add by scanning the following QR code:

#### IzzyOnDroid F-Droid repo

The app is also available via the IzzyOnDroid repo [here](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/jhass.eu.insporation).

In case you want to dare anyways:

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
2. Install Android SDK / Xcode
3. Clone this repo
4. Connect your debugging enabled device and `flutter run` :)
